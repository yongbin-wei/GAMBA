# GAMBA
GAMBA is a web-based application (www.dutchconnectomelab.nl/GAMBA/) that can be used to test whether the gene expression profile(s) of the input gene(s) and neuroimaging-derived brain features show overlapped spatial patterns. Source code of the website can be found at XXXX.

# Processing
GAMBA is a front-end interaction interface based on pre-processed gene transcrptiomic data and imaging data. Processing steps and statistical analyses are included in ./processing

# Examples
We use three simple examples that show analyses commonly performed in literature to illustrate the usage of different statistical null models. Examples include human-supragranular-enriched (HSE) genes, APOE gene, and risk genes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Relevant scripts are included in ./examples

# Simulation
We simulate and analyze the outcome of different statistical evaluation approaches for a wide range of real brain phenotypes and artificial gradients. Relevant scripts are included in ./simulation
