# GAMBA
Wei Y. et al., Statistical testing and annotation of gene transcriptomic-neuroimaging associations, in preparation.

# Examples
We used three simple examples that showed analyses commonly performed in literature to illustrate the usage of different statistical null models. Examples include human-supragranular-enriched (HSE) genes, APOE gene, and risk genes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

# Simulation
We simulated and analyzed the outcome of different statistical evaluation approaches for a wide range of real brain phenotypes and artificial gradients.
